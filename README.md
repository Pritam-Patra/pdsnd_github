### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I had to write code to :
(a) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and 
(b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
(a) chicago.csv
(b) new_york_city.csv
(c)	washington.csv
(d) bikeshare.py

### Requirements
This program was written in Python (version 3.8.2) and relies on the following libraries: 
pandas==0.23.4, 
numpy==1.15.4
